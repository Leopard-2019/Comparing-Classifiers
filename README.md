<h2>Business Understanding</h2>
The Business task is identify which client will subscribe a term deposit or not based on several independent factors by using different machine learning classification models: KNeighborsClassifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. The best model will be selected by comparing their metrics, and other indicator such as the Precision-recal curve, and confusion matrix. The analysis will be done using python & jupyter notebook.
